## Acknowledgments

This theme is built upon several amazing contributions from the Roam Research community:

- [Masonry Vanilla theme](https://gitmurf.github.io/masonry-vanilla/) by GitMurf, which provides the foundational masonry layout and functionality
- [Lisa Marie Cabrelli](https://www.youtube.com/@LisaMarieCabrelli/playlists), whose "Roam for Results" course demonstrated the practical application and effectiveness of this theme style
- The broader Roam Research community for their continuous contributions and improvements to the theming ecosystem

The combination of these resources inspired the creation of this card-based theme to enhance the note-taking experience in Roam Research.
